### Guide Completion Status:
✅ **Complete HTML tanking guide** with all combat mechanics
✅ **34 comprehensive sources** researched and documented
✅ **Professional footnote system** with 8 major citations
✅ **Authentic source archive** with website-matching styling
✅ **Complete cross-referencing** between all content

## Research Foundation Established

### Combat Mechanics Documented:
- **Attack Tables:** Both defensive (boss vs player) and offensive (player vs boss)
- **Threat Formulas:** Complete stance multipliers and ability values
- **Weapon Skill:** Critical breakpoints (305, 308) with precise benefits
- **Hit Rating:** Caps for different scenarios with weapon skill interactions
- **Shield Block:** Mechanics for crushing blow immunity
- **Stat Priorities:** Both threat-focused and survivability builds

### Mathematical Foundation:
- **Threat Generation:** 1:1 damage, 1:0.25 healing, 5:1 rage ratios
- **Stance Multipliers:** 149.5% in Defensive with Defiance talent
- **Miss Formulas:** Level and weapon skill dependent calculations
- **Attack Power Scaling:** 14 AP = 1 DPS, various class conversions
- **Critical Strike:** Attack table limitations and caps

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Development Tasks:
1. **Design gear optimization algorithms** based on established research
2. **Create project structure** for BiS optimizer application
3. **Implement gear database** with complete Classic item stats
4. **Build optimization engine** incorporating all combat mechanics
5. **Create character data extraction** system (WoW addon integration)

### Technical Requirements Identified:
- **WoW Addon Development:** For real-time character gear extraction
- **Gear Database:** Complete itemization for all Classic phases
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Multi-objective optimization (threat vs survival)
- **Validation System:** Compare results against established simulators
- **User Interface:** Intuitive gear recommendation display

## Key Learning Highlights

### Research Insights:
- **Weapon skill dominance:** 305 skill more impactful than most gear pieces
- **Shield Block priority:** Ability uptime trumps individual gear optimization  
- **Attack table complexity:** Level differences create caps and penalties throughout
- **Threat vs Survival:** Modern tanking heavily emphasizes TPS optimization

### Documentation Quality:
- **Source diversity:** 11+ different website types and communities
- **Cross-validation:** Multiple sources confirm critical mechanics
- **Academic rigor:** Professional footnoting enhances credibility
- **Visual authenticity:** Archived sources maintain original site experience
