- Kill order - Orc Mage > Orc Warrior > Dragonkin. When 5 eggs left, focus DPS on Dragonkins because the Orcs will despawn

**__Vaelastrasz__**
- Everyone - Take a Greater Fire Protection Potion
- Warriors/Rogues - North. Watch your threat (especially on the opener and on Execute phase)
- Mana class - South. Move to the West pillar when you get Burning Adrenaline. All your spells will be instant cast, so keep casting as you move. If you're not interested in the loot Vael drops, take the port.
- One Mage - Start opening a port on the West pillar 30s before the fight starts.
- Healers - Pump heal on the main tank especially on the opener as they will take the most damage for 15s when Recklessness is up.
- Main tank - East. Start the dialogue from the tail and move to East (it will guarantee that your first attack will not parry). Stay in Berserker stance before combat. Pop Recklessness 1s before the combat starts, and switch to Defensive stance. Pop Mighty Rage Potion, Deathwish and convert all your hits to HS. Switch to Battle stance on Execute Phase and spam Execute while keep queueing HS. Don't hesitate to pop Last Stand/LGG.

**__Death Talon Captain pack x6__**
- Kill order: Seether > Flamescale > Wyrmkin > Captain
- Captain - A Hunter will be kiting
- Wyrmkin (x1-2) - Druids - keep them sleeped. Tanks - tank them faced away from raid to avoid raid getting hit by Fireball Volley
- Flamescale/Seether - Stack and cleave them.
- Everyone - Flamescale will charge and knock you back. Don't get charged into the room.
- Tanks - Seether will put Flame Buffet on you which amplifies damage from Captain's Aura of Flames. It's normally 150 every time you hit the Captain, but it's amplified to 2k when you have Flame Buffet. Watch your health closely when tanking the Captain.

__**Suppression Room**__
- Rogues - Stay stealthed and disarm traps around the right wall. Don't go near the Talon Hatchers. They will break your stealth from aura damage.
