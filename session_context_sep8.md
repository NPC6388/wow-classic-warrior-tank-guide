# WoW Classic Warrior Tanking Guide - Session Context (September 8, 2025)

## Session Overview
This session focused on refining the WoW Classic Warrior Tanking Guide with Shield Block mechanics clarification and advanced technique enhancements.

## Key Files Updated
- **Main Guide**: `wow_classic_tanking_guide.html` - Shield Block mechanics and advanced technique updates
- **Session Context**: `session_context_sep8.md` - This document for session continuity

## Changes Completed This Session

### 1. Shield Block Mechanics Clarification
- **Attack Table Update**: Corrected Critical Hit row to show Shield Block as alternative to 440 defense
  - Changed from: "440 defense goal for immunity OR Shield Block pushes off table"
  - Changed to: "440 defense goal for immunity OR Shield Block active (2 attacks)"
- **OT Considerations Update**: Updated defense requirement explanation
  - Changed from: "440+ defense goal prevents crushing blows and crits"
  - Changed to: "440+ defense goal or Shield Block active prevents crits"

**Key Mechanic Clarified**: Shield Block ability converts the next 2 incoming attacks into blocks, which cannot be critical hits, providing temporary crit immunity regardless of defense rating.

### 2. Advanced Technique Enhancements
- **Mitigation Flexibility**: Updated advanced technique note for clarity
  - Changed from: "switching to mitigation gear (shield + defense) only when necessary"
  - Changed to: "switching to mitigation gear and/or shield only when necessary"
- **Context Addition**: Added important dependency factors
  - Added: "This is dependent on raid comp and gear, as well as the fight duration and any additional fight-specific mechanics"

### 3. Off-Tank (OT) Considerations Enhancement
- **DPS Stance Clarification**: Added default stance information for OTs
  - Updated: "Expected to deal significant damage when not actively tanking (default stance: Berserker)"

## Technical Improvements Made
- **Shield Block Accuracy**: Corrected common misconception about defense requirements for crit immunity
- **Flexibility Emphasis**: Better representation of tank gear switching strategies
- **Context Awareness**: Added important situational factors for advanced techniques
- **Role Clarity**: Clearer guidance for OT stance management

## Current Guide Status
- **Mechanical Accuracy**: Excellent - Shield Block mechanics properly explained
- **Advanced Strategies**: Enhanced - better context for gear switching decisions
- **Role Guidance**: Improved - clearer OT stance and gear recommendations
- **Encounter Mechanics**: Accurate base information maintained

## Files Status
- **Main Guide**: Updated with refined mechanics explanations and advanced technique context
- **Sources**: Maintained and properly referenced
- **Context Document**: New session context created

## Key Session Accomplishments
- **Shield Block Clarification**: Corrected important tanking mechanic misunderstanding
- **Advanced Technique Context**: Added crucial dependency factors
- **OT Role Enhancement**: Better stance guidance for off-tanks
- **Mechanical Precision**: Improved accuracy of defensive mechanics explanations

## Notes for Next Session

### High Priority Updates Needed
1. **OT-Specific Encounters**: Update and expand the OT-Specific Encounters section
   - Review current encounter list for completeness
   - Add missing encounters that require specific OT strategies
   - Update encounter mechanics and OT responsibilities
   - Verify accuracy of current encounter descriptions

2. **Encounter-Specific Requirements**: Comprehensive review and update
   - Validate all resistance values mentioned in encounter-specific requirements
   - Verify HP requirements for specific encounters (Twin Emperors teleport, etc.)
   - Check defense requirements for encounter-specific sections
   - Update any outdated encounter mechanics or strategies

### Specific Areas to Review
- **BWL Encounters**: Verify OT roles for Vaelastrasz, Broodlord, Chromaggus
- **AQ40 Encounters**: Review Twin Emperors, C'Thun, Viscidus OT requirements
- **Naxxramas Encounters**: Update Patchwerk, Four Horsemen, Sapphiron, KT OT roles
- **MC Encounters**: Verify if any encounters need OT-specific callouts

### Additional Considerations
- Cross-reference encounter requirements with current meta strategies
- Ensure resistance values match current understanding
- Verify HP thresholds are accurate for current gear levels
- Check if any new OT strategies have emerged for specific encounters

## Current Guide Strengths
- Comprehensive mechanical explanations with proper Shield Block understanding
- Well-organized consumables sections with accurate categorization
- Strong Flask Set implementation with correct Diamond Flask mechanics
- Accurate combat formulas and Flurry uptime calculations
- Good balance of basic and advanced tanking strategies

The guide now has excellent mechanical accuracy and is ready for the next phase of encounter-specific content refinement.
