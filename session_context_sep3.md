# WoW Classic Warrior Tanking Guide - Session Context (September 3, 2025)

## Session Overview
This session focused on refining and polishing the WoW Classic Warrior Tanking Guide with title updates, consumables reorganization, stat table additions, and accuracy corrections.

## Key Files Updated
- **Main Guide**: `wow_classic_tanking_guide.html` - Multiple refinements and corrections
- **Session Context**: `session_context_sep3.md` - This document for session continuity

## Changes Completed This Session

### 1. Title and Subtitle Updates
- **Updated main title**: Changed to "Tankenheimer's WoW Classic Warrior Tanking Guide"
- **Updated subtitle**: Changed to "An *Attempted* Complete Mechanics and Optimization Guide for Tanks and DPS"
- **Updated footer**: Simplified to show only "Last Updated: September 2025"

### 2. Stat Table Enhancement
- **Added Stamina row**: Added stamina to the critical stat conversion table
  - Conversion: 1 Stamina = 10 Health
  - Key thresholds: 8,000+ HP for Patchwerk, higher for Four Horsemen/Twin Emperors
  - Priority: High (Survivability)

### 3. Simulator Section Improvements
- **Added critical warning**: "All simulator results should be taken with a grain of salt"
- **Added specific note**: Mentioned that sims can over-value hit and weapon skill in certain scenarios
- **Enhanced disclaimer**: Emphasized simulators assume perfect play and optimal conditions

### 4. Build Clarifications
- **Fury-Prot enhancement**: Updated description to emphasize it's "best for single-target tanking"
- **Threat/DPS emphasis**: Clarified that Fury-Prot generates "much higher threat and DPS" than pure protection

### 5. Consumables Complete Reorganization
- **Added type headers**: Organized consumables by category for both DPS and tank sections:
  - **Weapon Buffs**: Elemental/Dense Sharpening Stones
  - **Juju**: Juju Power (separate category, not potion/elixir)
  - **Potions/Elixirs**: Merged category for related consumables
  - **Food**: Strength foods (dumplings before sunfruit)
  - **Flasks**: Flask of the Titans
  - **Protection Potions**: All resistance and armor potions
  - **Healing**: Emergency healing consumables
  - **Drinks**: Rumsey Rum (separate from food)

- **DPS consumables additions**:
  - Added Blessed Sunfruit to DPS essential consumables
  - Added situational section with protection potions, healing items, and Greater Stoneshield
  - Added Whipper Root Tuber for emergency healing

- **Tank consumables additions**:
  - Added Greater Stoneshield Potion to tank situational

- **Food ordering**: Corrected order to show Smoked Desert Dumplings before Blessed Sunfruit (logical progression from higher to lower strength)

### 6. Consistency and Accuracy Corrections
- **440 Defense clarification**: Updated all references to specify "440 defense goal" rather than absolute requirement
- **Hit rating consistency**: Matched threat set priority wording with mitigation set ("essential for rage generation")
- **Encounter corrections**:
  - Removed incorrect "Armor Cap Priority" section (armor cap impossible in Classic)
  - Removed incorrect Sapphiron ground phase adds reference (Sapphiron is air phase only)

### 7. Classification Corrections
- **Juju Power**: Correctly classified as "Juju" category (not potion/elixir)
